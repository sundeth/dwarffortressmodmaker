For example, a value of 10 means that it should be able to reach the maximum speed by moving 10 tiles in a straight line over even terrain. <max turning speed> indicates the maximum speed permissible when the creature suddenly changes its direction of motion. The creature's speed will be reduced to <max turning speed> if travelling at a higher speed than this before turning. <energy expenditure> indicates how energy-consuming the gait is. Higher values cause the creature to tire out faster. Persistent usage of a high-intensity gait will eventually lead to exhaustion and collapse. NO_BUILD_UP can be specified instead of a <start speed> value to make the <max speed> instantly achievable upon initiating movement (this is equivalent to a <build up time> of 0). Note that <build up time> and <max turning speed> are both ignored if specified alongside this (as NO_BUILD_UP trumps <build up time> and preserves <max speed> whilst turning, and <max turning speed> cannot exceed <max speed>) so it is permissible to omit them so long as they are both omitted together. It's possible to specify a <start speed> greater than the <max speed>; the moving creature will decelerate towards its <max speed> in this case. valid gait types: WALK Used for moving normally over ground tiles.

Note that contact with items made of a syndrome-inducing material currently doesn't result in transmission. Methods of getting a material contaminant onto a creature's body include: secretions liquid projectiles (contaminate struck body parts if exposed) vapor and dust clouds (contaminate all external body parts, even if covered) puddles and dust piles (STANCE body parts become contaminated if the creature walks into them barefoot, and all uncovered external body parts are contaminated if the creature is prone) freakish rain (contaminates all external body parts, even if covered, if the creature is outside) unprotected bodily contact with a contaminated creature (including performing or receiving body part attacks such as punches and wrestling moves, creature collisions, as well as CONTACT interaction effects, if the involved body parts are exposed) items melting whilst equipped or hauled (this contaminates the body part that was holding them if exposed) striking the creature's body with a contaminated item (see below) It is possible to use this token for syndromes intended to be applied via envenomed weapons (but also check out SYN_INJECTED). When a creature's body is struck with an item which is contaminated with a contact syndrome-inducing material, the syndrome will be transmitted to the struck creature, even if the attack doesn't pierce the flesh. Syndrome transmission in this context often occurs in the absence of a visible contaminant on the body. Contact transmission only appears to occur at the moment of contamination (which is to say, when a new bodily spatter is created). If the syndrome ends (once all its creature effects reach their END point, at which point it will be removed from the creature), it will NOT be reapplied by the original syndrome-inducing contaminant (assuming it hasn't been cleaned off yet); the creature will need to be recontaminated with the causative material for this to occur. (Note that in the case of secretions, the secreted contaminants are continuously reapplied to the secretory body parts, so any associated short-lasting contact syndromes allowed to target the secreting creature can potentially be reapplied at the rate of secretion; this may work differently in adventurer mode)."},{"type":"SYNDROME","token":"SYN_INGESTED","arguments":"","context":null,"description":"If the syndrome is tied to a material, creatures who eat or drink substances comprising, containing or contaminated with this material will contract the syndrome if this token is included.

Only one identifier may be specified per syndrome. Syndrome identifiers can be used in conjunction with the SYNDROME_DILUTION_FACTOR creature token to alter a creature’s innate resistance to the relevant effects of any syndromes that possess the specified identifier. For example, every alcoholic beverage in unmodded games comes with its own copy of an intoxicating syndrome, each of which has a [SYN_IDENTIFIER:INEBRIATION] token. All dwarves have [SYNDROME_DILUTION_FACTOR:INEBRIATION:150], which decreases the severity of any effects derived from a syndrome with the INEBRIATION identifier, thus enabling them to better handle all forms of alcohol. A creature can only possess a single syndrome with a particular identifier at any given time. As such, if a creature contracts a syndrome with a particular identifier and is subsequently exposed to another syndrome with a matching identifier whilst that first syndrome is still active, then this later obtained syndrome will not be contracted. If the latter comes with a SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED token, it will instead adjust the first syndrome's concentration as described below. Taking the above example once again, a sober dwarf drinking their first alcoholic beverage would be exposed to an INEBRIATION syndrome, contracting it and having its effects manifest normally. If the dwarf were to have another drink before the effects of this first syndrome have all worn off (by reaching their END point), then exposure to the second INEBRIATION syndrome would only increase the severity of the original syndrome's effects, making the dwarf progressively more intoxicated."},{"type":"SYNDROME","token":"SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDEDv0.42.01","arguments":"<amount>:<max>","context":null,"description":"Syndrome concentration is essentially a quantity which impacts the severity of the syndrome's relevant effects. The higher the syndrome's concentration, the greater its severity. When a syndrome is contracted, the value specified in <amount> is its initial concentration level. As described above, if a creature is exposed to a syndrome with a particular SYN_IDENTIFIER when already possessing an active syndrome with the same identifier, then this later syndrome isn't contracted, instead contributing to the original syndrome's concentration as indicated by its SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED token, if present. The syndrome in question will increase the original syndrome's concentration by <amount> whenever the creature is exposed to it, until its specified <max> concentration is reached by the original syndrome, causing subsequent exposure to this particular syndrome to do nothing (that is, until the original syndrome ends, at which point a new one may be contracted normally). Should the creature be exposed to a different syndrome with the same identifier and a higher <max> value, the concentration will of course increase further. For example, all forms of alcohol in the vanilla game have a syndrome with [SYN_IDENTIFIER:INEBRIATION] and [SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED:100:1000]. When alcohol is first drunk, the creature contracts the relevant inebriating syndrome at a concentration level of 100. Every subsequent drink will increase the concentration of this first syndrome by a further 100, intensifying its effects, until it plateaus at concentration level 1000. Once all the effects of the original syndrome have ended, the cycle can be started anew (assuming the drinker hasn't died of alcohol poisoning yet). As described by Toady, \"Each 100 of <amount> will contribute SEV in general to each effect (before dilution), <max> goes up to 1000. The concentration does not decrease, but will stay at the maximum attained until the syndrome wears off.\" Some of the generated interaction-derived syndromes come with [SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED:1000:0]. According to Toady, this \"was a precaution after I had one bug with effects not fully manifesting due to low levels. It may not be necessary, but I decided to give everybody a full dose of the juice until I could get a closer look at it.\" [1]"}],"ITEM_WEAPON":[{"type":"ITEM_WEAPON","token":"NAME","arguments":"singular plural","context":null,"description":"Name of the weapon.
